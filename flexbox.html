      I am enlightened to see you are interested in booking a photoshoot with
      me! 📷 A little bit about myself… My name is Nicole, I am raised in the
      Netherlands, and an avid and passionate explorer of Mother Earth 🌎. I
      love discovering new places🌋, meeting new people🙋🏻‍♀, and capturing
      precious moments. Throughout the years, my love for photography has grown.
      My motto, however, remained the same “to leave footprints of love
      everywhere I go, always and everywhere.” It would be my honour to capture
      the beauty of life with and for you! Because it is true what they say, a
      picture can say more than a thousand words! 💎
